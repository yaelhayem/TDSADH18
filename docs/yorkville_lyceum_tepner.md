---

&nbsp;&nbsp; A very instructive lecture was recently delievered beofe the Yorkville Library Association, upon the "Physical Structure of Man," by Dr. C. D. Griswold. The lecturere commenced with general remarks upon the progress of physical science in the present age, and especially in all that pertains to "speed," while Health, the great element of individual, and, in the aggregate, of national prosperity, is greatly neglected.

&nbsp;&nbsp; As an example to show how necessary it is to know the functions of the various organs, in order to be able to take a rational care of health, the structure and function of the lungs was treated of at some length, in connection with the digestive and vascular systems. The lungs, said the lecturer, are two organs situation in the lateral cavities of the chest, with the heart between them; they are a minute net-work of blood vessels ann air passages. Their capacity for air is thirteen pints—the termination of each air-tube being a minute cell.The impure blood from the system is conveyed through them by vessels directly from the heart, which divide up until they are too small to be seen without a microscope; and, after passing around the air cells where the blood gives off its carbon and receives in place of it oxygen from the air in tho cells it returns to the heart, and from thence is forced throught the system in thispurified or re-öxygenated state. To carry on this function 57 hogsheads of blood pass through them in the same time; and cosequently as there are but 24 pounds of blood in the system it was all subjected to this process of reöxygenation 540 times in 24 hours. These facts were made to show the great necessity for the rapid generaation of animal heat. The boyd must be maintained at a temperature of 98°, and is an atmosphere of 32°, 57 hogshead of air must receive 66° of heat from the lungs in 24 hours, besides a much larger quantity given off from the surface of the boyd, The generation of animal heat was ascribed to the combustion taking place between the carbon of the blood, and oxygen of the blood, and carbon of the decomposing tissues in every part of the system; the body being constantly in a state of decomposition and regeneration, and the lungs the medium through which the carbon is thrown off, and oxygen taken in, this last being an important element in the process of nutrition.

&nbsp;&nbsp; The Liver was alluded to as an accessory organ to the lungs, and as performing the entire function of respiration previous to birth, and nearly so with many of the lower animals, such as fishes and reptiles; the creted from it in the liver, and afterwards made to perform an important office in the processs of digestion which had been previously described.

&nbsp;&nbsp; The organs of the digestive, respiratory and vascular system were exhibited in a beautiful model of *papier maché* made by the Messrs. Hyatts of this city, and the first ever manufactured in this country.
