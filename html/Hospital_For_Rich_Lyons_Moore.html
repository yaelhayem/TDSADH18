<!-- 
This page is to be used as the template for your own HTML page.  This content at the top is considered a "comment" and will not display
when the web page is viewed online. The "tags" that surround this text is what causes the text to be interpreted as a comment.  HTML
works via the use of tags, which usually come in pairs; an opening tag and a closing tag.  HTML tags are identified as tags by the 
"<" and ">" symbols; the tag goes between the opening symbol (<) and the closing symbol (>).  The opening tag is usually text, and the 
closing tag usually consists of a forward slash (/) followed by the same text that is in the opening tag.  But not always. Comment tags 
are an example of something different. Comments are used in the rest of this page to describe the code that follows each comment.
-->

<!--
The next line is a a special tag that is not really HTML. It tells web browsers that the rest of this page is a particular type of HTML
(the current version is HTML 5), so the browser knows how to display the content. It does not have a closing tag.
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!--
Now the actual HTML tags start. Notice that the next tag (<html>) tells the browser "here is where the HTML starts."  At the bottom of 
this document, you will this tag: </html>.  The forward slash (/) is HTML code for "end."  As noted above, almost but not all HTML tags
come in pairs like this.
-->
<html>
  	
	<!--
	The <head> tag sets the header for the page. Headers include metadata that indicate what type of formatting should be used
	among other things. Also note that indenting is used each time an opening  tag is used, then the indenting is reduced when the 
	closing tag is used. This helps make the page more clear to the coder.
	-->
	<head> 
		
		<!--
		The next tag is a metadata tag instructing browsers to use the Unicode protocol for interpreting characters. Unicode is
		a common standard that is used for virtually all web pages. This tag does not have a closing tag.
		-->
		<meta charset="utf-8">  
    		
		<!--
		The next tag sets the title. This is displayed in the browser tab. Change it to the title of your page.
		-->
		<title>       
			Hospital For Rich 
		</title> 
		<!--
		The tag above this closes the title.
		-->
		
		<!--
		The next tag is another special tag without a closing tag; this one tells the page where to find formatting instructions.
		The instructions are in anoteher file in this repository. The file is a "Cascading Style Sheet", in the "styles" folder.
		The file name ends with ".css" and contains HTML code in a special format.  It is what determines the font size and 
		color, what a link should look like, what the margins of the page should be, what the background should look like; in 
		fact, the style sheet can describe every visual element of the page. (Browsers have default values that will be used if 
		the style sheet does not explicitly say what to use).  You should make a new style sheet for your page, and change this 
		line so your style sheet will be used. (Make sure your style sheet is inside the styles folder.)
		-->
    		<link href="../styles/template.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
		
		<!--
		Another special tag; similar to the last one, but this one creates the little image in the page's tab; the "faviocon."
		-->
		<link href="../images/hfav.png" rel="icon" type="image/png">
		
	<!--
	The next tag closes the header.
	-->
  	</head>
	
	<!--
	The next tag starts the body of the web page.  The content inside the body tags is what is displayed online.
	-->
	<body>
		
		<!--
		The <h1> tag is the "big headline" tag.  Your style sheet will determine how the big headlines are displayed, and what
		they should look like (these include "shadows"). There are tags for smaller headlines as well (<h2>, <h3>, etc).
		-->
		<h1>
			Hospital for Rich Now Aids East Side  <!--This is the big headline to be displayed-->
		</h1>
		
		<!--
		The <p> tag creates a paragraph with formatting determined by your style sheet. Use a <div> tag to format code that isn't
		in a paragraph (or to format collections of paragraphs). <div> means "division" and is used to group other elements
		together. After the <p> tag is text that will be displayed on the web page, in a paragraph.

			Doctors Hospital, once the medical preserve of the rich and famous on the Upper East Side, is becoming a highly 
			visable community hospital serving Yorkville's large elderly population and its growing influx of young professionals.
			Toward that end, the 54-year-old hospital, at 170 East End Avenue, at 86th Street, is undergoing a $40 million renovation
			that is expected to be completed by the end of next year. Gone are the private rooms overlooking Gracie Mansion, Carl 
			Schurz Park and the East River that were occupied over the years by such patients as James Thurber, Oscar Hammerstein 2d, 
			Claire Boothe Luce, Eugene O'Neill<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>, Eddie Cantor and Marilyn Monroe. While the views 
			are the same, most of the rooms are now semiprivate and relatively celebrity-free. Gone, too, are the hospital worker whose 
			only job was to polish silver and the food-service sommelier whose major preoccupation was selecting the right wine for 
			a patient's dinner.

			The <a href> tag creates a link (aka hyperlink). This link goes to my markdown page. You should change it
			so it links to your markdown page.  Hyperlink tags include the address of the link in quotes; this one is an
			"internal" link as it points to a file in this repository.  The ".." means move back one folder (this page is
			in the html folder), and each slash (/) means move forward one folder or file.  The address is "closed" with 		
			">" and then the text of the link is written, followed by the actual closing tag (</a>)
