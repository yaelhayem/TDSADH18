	<br><b>F</b>ROM a neighborhood that in 1900 was second in the world only to Berlin in the number of German residents, the area of the Upper East Side known as Yorkville has been transformed into a mostly upscale community that is more silk stocking than lederhosen.

</p>
<p>
	<br>The dispersion of the Germans - and the Hungarians, Irish, and Slavs who followed then - resulted from the demoltion of the Third Avenue El in 1955 and the ensuing boom in high-rise apartment constructions. High rents altered the neighborhood's character, bringing more of a cross section of people to liv in housing that ranges from the million-dollar co-ops of East End Avenue to doorman rental buildings to low- and middle-income housing.
</p>
<p>	
	<br>Today's Yorkville is a bustling area, with streets that provide diversions that a moneyed, heterogeneious community desires. Gimbel's Department Store rises 11 stories at 86th Street and Lexington Avenue. There are squash clubs, first-run movie houses and restaurants that offer all variety of cuisine. 
</p>
<p>
		<br>But Yorkville is more than its "action" for those who settle there. The area posseses a certain cachet - it is an address that confers status. "If you've arrived," said Assemblyman Alexander B. Grannis, an East Side Democrat, "you go to the Upper East Side."
</p>
<p>
	<br>"It's a very solid community," he added. "It's percieved as safe. It's got a good transportation. It's been a traditionally strong neighborhood, with more of a sense of community and stability - even with the real-estate boom. A solid community, made up of people with a degree of social conscience. These are people that have traditionally civil-libertarian sentiments - the kind of people that elected Lindsay and Koch."
</p>
<p>
	<br>Yorkville - bounded by 79th and 96th Streets between Lexington Avenue and the East River - is typically associated with the German community that lived and worked there and gave its streets (particularly those around 86th Street and Third Avenue) their ethnic character.
</p>
<p>
	<br>The German influence was established in the early 1800's by prosperous families like the Rupperts, Ringlings, and Ehrets, who had their homes in Yorkville - and by other aristocrats like the Astors, Primes and Rhinelanders, who occupied river and country estates close by.
</p>
<p>
	<br>Brownstones and tenement houses began to go up by 1835 following the opening of the New York and Harlem Railroad and a stagecoach line. The new housing attracted both prosperous and working-class Germans, and many laborers found employemnt in Yorkville's plants and breweries. =
</p>
<p>
	<br>The ethnic legacy can be seen amid the high-rise developments, the smart shops and antiques stores. Notices posted otuside churches advise that services can be taken in German or Hungarian. In a few stores, Yorkville old-timers still buy delicacies that were once common supplies.
</p>
<p>
	<br>Schaller & Weber, on Second Avenue between 85th and 86th Streets since 1937, sells wieners, knackwurst, bockwurts, bauernwurst and varieties of kielbasa and hams, as myriad "pork stores" in the neighborhood once did. From the front door of Lekvar-by-the-Barrel, at First Avenue and 82nd Street since 1926, drift the scents of spices and herbs - including the Hungarian paprika that the store's catalogue boasts is "perfect for soups, salads - and, of course, the most popular Hungarian dish of all - goulash!"
</p>
<p>
	<br>Bremen House, at 220 East 86th Street, does a brisk business not only in gourmet fare, but also in German-language magazines and records. And for those whose palates are enticed by Wiener schnitzel, sauerbraten or maybe chopped chicken livers, there are German restaurants like Cafe Geiger at 206 East 86th Street and, for a less formal atmosphere, the Ideal Cafe 238 East 86th Street. 
</p>
<p>
	<br>"Yorkville back when the Third Avenue El was up was delightful," recalled Helen Banyai, who grew up there and still attends services with her husband at the Hungarian Baptist Church. "There were different ethnic groups and wonderful odors from the restaurants and bakeries, and you could stroll past doorways where continental music could be heard - performed by violinsts and gypsy musicians."
</p>
<p>
	<br>The economic pressures on the community's housing stock brought on by a growing population is one of Yorkville's biggest concerns. Sprinkled amoung the middle- and upper-middle-class buildings are many old rent-controlled tenement buildings and walk-ups with poor and elderly tenants, many of whom are being bought out or harassed into moving to make way for new high-rise buildings.
</p>
<p>
	<br>When three- to five-room walk-ups and railroad flat are vacated, they rent for $400 to $700 a month, according to Robert Henry of Method Reality. 
</p>
<p>
	<br>Addy Fattal, director of rentals at J.I. Sopher, said rents on one- to three-bedroom apartments in elevator buildings with doormen ranged from $850 to more than $2,800. Edith Sachs, vice-president and director of co-op sales for Sopher, said it was possible to find one- and two-bedroom aparments for $110,000 to $160,000 on the "very low end of the market." But most co-ops are more costly, especially in buildings offering river views along East End Avenue and Gracie Square. 
</p>
<p>
	<br><b>B</b>Y comparison with other parts of the city, Yorkville is not particularly afflicted by violent street crime: Its most conspicious problems - prostitution and drug sales - are visible on East 96th Street. Burglaries are numerous, particularly in the old tenement and walk-up buildings, which offer an intruder easy access. But overall, said Detective Jack McGuire of the 19th Preinct, "It is a neighborhood that is safe to go out and walk in."
</p>
<p>
	<br>Yorkville still has the conveniences and comforts that attracted bordes of young people in the late 1960's before the rental market tightened up at the same time that the city's fiscal crisis began.
</p>
<p>
	<br>"That's when people realized they had to take charge of their lives and not depend on government," said Paulette Geanacopolous, director of community services at the Lenox Hill Neighborhood Association. "The feeling was, 'Hey, we're here now, and we're going to be here in five years because we can't afford to be anywhere else. In five years, the problems are going to be worse, so let's start working on them now.'"
</p>
<p>
	<br>That meant working with the neighborhood's block associations which, by establishing programs to beautify streets, aid the elderly and curb crime, have at least partially restored the community feeling for which Yorkville was once famous. "One way we fight crime is to put stickers on store windows," said Dawn Sullivan, president of the 400 East 80th Street Block Association. "These stickers let people know this is place they can go to if they are being followed, a place where they can use the telephone or just wait until the danger passes."
</p>
<p>
	<br>Yorkville has more than two dozen public, parochial and private schools, including P.S. 158, which had the highest reading scores in Manhattan this past year. Many parents tend to send their children to private schools after the sixth grade - Brearley and Chapin are amoung the better-known. Speaking of the junior high school that serves the Yorkville area, however, Charles N. Wilson, superintendent of Community School District 2, said, "The majority of students graduating from Wagner Junior High School go on to the specialized high schools such as Stuyvesant, Bronx Science, Brooklyn Tech and Music and Arts."
</p>
<p>
	<br>Yorkville has recently responded to the growing problem of the homeless, with organizations like the Coalition for Shelter, Lenox Hill Neighborhood Association, Jan Hus House, The Common Pantry and the Stanley Isaacs Neighborhood Center working to give street people places to stay. In Assemblyman Grannis's words, "Yorkville is a very socially compassionate area."
</p>
<p>
	<br>In that neighborly spirit, Manhattan Savings Bank, on Third Avenue and 86th Street, offers daily music for a mostly elderly audience that gathers midday to hear a pianist play on bank premises.
</p>
<p>
	<br>And for those who love the outdoors, there are other amenities. At Carl Schurz Park, a walkway overlooking the East River is trafficked by joggers, strollers and bench jockeys who watch the gulls and barges go by.
