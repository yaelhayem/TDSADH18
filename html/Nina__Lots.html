<!-- 
This page is to be used as the template for your own HTML page.  This content at the top is considered a "comment" and will not display
when the web page is viewed online. The "tags" that surround this text is what causes the text to be interpreted as a comment.  HTML
works via the use of tags, which usually come in pairs; an opening tag and a closing tag.  HTML tags are identified as tags by the 
"<" and ">" symbols; the tag goes between the opening symbol (<) and the closing symbol (>).  The opening tag is usually text, and the 
closing tag usually consists of a forward slash (/) followed by the same text that is in the opening tag.  But not always. Comment tags 
are an example of something different. Comments are used in the rest of this page to describe the code that follows each comment.
-->

<!--
The next line is a a special tag that is not really HTML. It tells web browsers that the rest of this page is a particular type of HTML
(the current version is HTML 5), so the browser knows how to display the content. It does not have a closing tag.
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!--
Now the actual HTML tags start. Notice that the next tag (<html>) tells the browser "here is where the HTML starts."  At the bottom of 
this document, you will this tag: </html>.  The forward slash (/) is HTML code for "end."  As noted above, almost but not all HTML tags
come in pairs like this.
-->
<html>
  	
	<!--
	The <head> tag sets the header for the page. Headers include metadata that indicate what type of formatting should be used
	among other things. Also note that indenting is used each time an opening  tag is used, then the indenting is reduced when the 
	closing tag is used. This helps make the page more clear to the coder.
	-->
	<Head> 
		
		<!--
		The next tag is a metadata tag instructing browsers to use the Unicode protocol for interpreting characters. Unicode is
		a common standard that is used for virtually all web pages. This tag does not have a closing tag.
		-->
		<meta charset="utf-8">  
    		
		<!--
		The next tag sets the title. This is displayed in the browser tab. Change it to the title of your page.
		-->
		<title>       
			Nina's Page 
		</title> 
		<!--
		The tag above this closes the title.
		-->
		
		<!--
		The next tag is another special tag without a closing tag; this one tells the page where to find formatting instructions.
		The instructions are in anoteher file in this repository. The file is a "Cascading Style Sheet", in the "styles" folder.
		The file name ends with ".css" and contains HTML code in a special format.  It is what determines the font size and 
		color, what a link should look like, what the margins of the page should be, what the background should look like; in 
		fact, the style sheet can describe every visual element of the page. (Browsers have default values that will be used if 
		the style sheet does not explicitly say what to use).  You should make a new style sheet for your page, and change this 
		line so your style sheet will be used. (Make sure your style sheet is inside the styles folder.)
		-->
    		<link href="../styles/Nina.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
		
		<!--
		Another special tag; similar to the last one, but this one creates the little image in the page's tab; the "faviocon."
		-->
		<link href="../images/hfav.png" rel="icon" type="image/png">
		
	<!--
	The next tag closes the header.
	-->
  	</head>
	
	<!--
	The next tag starts the body of the web page.  The content inside the body tags is what is displayed online.
	-->
	<body>
		
		<!--
		The <h1> tag is the "big headline" tag.  Your style sheet will determine how the big headlines are displayed, and what
		they should look like (these include "shadows"). There are tags for smaller headlines as well (<h2>, <h3>, etc).
		-->
		<h1>
			Desirable Lots <!--This is the big headline to be displayed-->
		</h1>
		
		<!--
		The <p> tag creates a paragraph with formatting determined by your style sheet. Use a <div> tag to format code that isn't
		in a paragraph (or to format collections of paragraphs). <div> means "division" and is used to group other elements
		together. After the <p> tag is text that will be displayed on the web page, in a paragraph.

		<p>
			This is my html page to house my advertisment for desirable lots in Yorkville from 1852. I chose this because it is a very early reference to Yorkville. At this time, Yorkville was not a developed part of the city. In 1852, Central Park had not even been designed, and the area uptown around it was little more than farmland. It's hard to imagine what kind of "lots" were for sale and what the intended plan for them was.

		The next tag closes the paragraph.

		</p>
		
		<!--
		Another paragraph begins.

			Here is a picture:
			<!--
			This is a link to an image from the images folder.  The text after alt= serves as the title that pops up when
			a viewer puts her cursor over the image, but more importantly, is read by screen readers used by those with 
			limited vision.
			-->
			<img src="../images/dlots.png" alt="Desirable Lots">
			<!--
			The <a href> tag creates a link (aka hyperlink). This link goes to my markdown page. You should change it
			so it links to your markdown page.  Hyperlink tags include the address of the link in quotes; this one is an
			"internal" link as it points to a file in this repository.  The ".." means move back one folder (this page is
			in the html folder), and each slash (/) means move forward one folder or file.  The address is "closed" with 		
			">" and then the text of the link is written, followed by the actual closing tag (</a>)
			-->
			<a href = "../docs/DesireableLots">This is a link to my annotated Markdown page</a> that transcribes the 
			first few paragraphs of the article and includes a link to an image from the Viele map showing the area as it appeared in 1865.
		<!--
		The second paragraph is closed. More paragraphs follow.

	<!--
	The next tag closes the body of this web page.

 	</body>
	
<!--
The next tag is the final tag, closing the initial HTML tag.
