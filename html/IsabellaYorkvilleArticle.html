 <br>YORKVILLE, once a grity working-class neighborhood of German, Irish, and Hungarian immigrants, is gradually 
      becoming part of the Upper East Side to which it had long been attached more by geography than character. 
      The changes are perhaps best revealed not by the impact studies ofurban planners, but by taking a walk. </p>
			
     <p> 
<br>Croissants appeared a few weeks ago at Glaser's Bake Shop on the corner of First Avenue and 87th Street, 
      where for eight decades the same family has been making linzer tortes and German coffee cakes. 
      The cozy old bar on the corner of Third Avenue and 91st Street has been transformed into a singles cafe 
      called Mumbles, and a few blocks down Third Avenue computers are being sold in what not too long ago was 
      an Irish grocery. </p>
   
<p>
<br> The parking lot between First and Second on 92nd Street is now a tennis court available for $500 to $750 a 
      year to tenants of the adjacent building, where one and two-bedroom apartments are being rented for $1,000 to 
      $1,400 a month. </p>
			
<p>
<br> At 96th Street, between Second and Third Avenues, a six-story apartment house that once was 
      a modest home for working-class families has been renovated as a cooperative, outfitted with brick 
      fireplaces and renamed The Fireside. On a recent Sunday, Mitchell Shenker, a salesman for Greystone Realty, 
      described precisely the kind of customers he expects to buy the one-bedroom apartments that start there at 
      $136,000: "People on the way up." </p>

<p>
<br>  And in this neighborhood that runs from 86th to 96th Streets, from Lexington Avenue 
      to the East River, there is also a surge of high rise development. Yale Robbins of Yale Robbins Inc., the 
      real-estate consultants, counts four structures of more than 16 stories that have been put up in the last 
      five years, plus several other large buildings.</p>
			
<p>   
<br> Developers now are planning to add at least eight more that will bring thousands of new residents, many of 
      them middle- and upper-middle-class people who themselves are in flight from even higher housing costs in other 
      parts of Manhattan. </p>
   
<p>
<br> This kind of redevelopment already has occured in what some residents think of as the southern party of Yorkville, 
      the east-of-Third-Avenue blocks between 79th and 86th Streets, but now it is moving uptown.</p>
   
<p>
<br>"The city has moved north, the pressures have moved north," said Assemblyman Alexander B. Grannis, a Democrat-Liberal
      who represents the district. "Now this area is a prie real-estate area. In the next 10 years, it's going to become 
      very chic and expensive - like the rest of the Upper East Side." </p>
   
<p>
<br>Within a decade, according to Mr. Robbins, the whole area will be totally developed. "And then the question is: 
      'Can it go above 96th Street?'" he said. Now under way, he added, is the construction of 980 apartment units, 
      and 1,300 more are possible in the next several years. </p>
  
<p>
<br>The newcomers pay rents that shock the old-timers living in $200-a-month rent stabilized railroad flats and are 
      viewed with some wariness by people like Susie Faldetta, 21 years old, who grew up in a tenement on 90th Street 
      and wistfully remembers the old days when "everybody knew everybody else and no one on the whole block was rich."</p>
  
<p>
<br>The newcomers have tastes that attract merchants like Beverly Fetner, who recently opened  Main Course, a gourmet 
      catering shop at 1608 Third Avenue near 90th Street. While Mrs. Fetner was at first skeptical about Yorkville- 
      "I used to drive down Second Avenue with my doors locked," she said- a quick study of the people who wait each
      morning for the Wall Street Express on the corner of 92nd Street and York Avenue convinced her that she would 
      have no trouble finding takers for such offerings as auvin, duck á l'orange and chocolate mousse.</p>
  
<p>
<br>''YOU could smell it - the young vital people who will be my market,'' she said as she supervised the final touches
      at her store, with its earth-tone walls and track lighting.</p>
  
<p>
<br>Like other new merchants and residents, Mrs. Fetner turned to Yorkville when she found she could not afford the rents
      elsewhere. She said she was paying $1,750 a month for her 750 square feet of shop space; a comparable amount of space
      on Columbus Avenue, on the West Side, would have cost her $3,700 a month.</p>

<p>
<br>Many of her customers will undoubtedly come from across the street, where the brick towers of the Ruppert Urban Renewal
      Project loom in place of the old RuppertBrewery that once provided jobs for the neighborhood. The apartment buildings
      - Ruppert Towers, Yorkville Towers and Knickerbocker Plaza - were completed eight years ago and the presence of 1,836
      Mitchell-Lama rental apartments is credited with spurring major redevelopment above 86th Street.</p>

<p>
<br>Three years ago, Eberhart Brothers Inc. bought five buildings between Second and Third Avenues on the north side of 96th
      Street - the unofficial dividing line between the Upper East Side and East Harlem - and renovated 40 apartments. The 
      rents began at $550 for a studio and $650 for a one-bedroom. </p>

<p>
<br>''We're shocked at the rents we got,'' Frank Eberhart said. ''We thought we'd do well. We didn't think we'd do that well. 
      There are investment bankers living in those buildings.''</p>

<p>
<br>Real-estate people and progress-minded residents invariably use the word exciting to describe such developments in 
      Yorkville, a neighborhood that until the post-World War II years was overwhelmingly German, Irish, Hungarian, Austrian,
      Czechoslovakian and, until recently, a less-than-fashionable address.</p>

<p>
<br>''Years ago,'' said Edith Fisher, chairman of the development committee of Community Board 8, with jurisdiction over 
      Yorkville, ''anything east of Third Avenue was declasse.'' Not everyone welcomes Yorkville's growing identification
      with the rest of the Upper East Side, however. Mrs. Fisher's board, for one, expressed its concern by asking the 
      Department of City Planning to prepare an impact study. It also is trying to downgrade some of the zoning along the
      mid-blocks.</p>

<p>
<br>Some people think there has already been too much change. ''The neighborhood's becoming sterile,'' said Tony Morenzi, 
who grew up there and now works as Assemblyman Grannis's assistant. On a walk around the streets of his childhood, he 
lamented the loss of such landmarks as Louie's Pharmacy on Second Avenue near 94th Street.</p>

<p>
<br>''If you got hurt, you didn't go to the doctor,'' he said. ''You went straight to Louie. He could give you a butterfly 
stitch.'' Louie's is now a Blimpie's.</p>

<p>
<br>Yorkville has always been a neighborhood of contrasts, where the Mayor's residence, Gracie Mansion, and the East End 
Avenue enclave of elegant apartments are only a few blocks from the Stanley Isaacs and John Haynes Holmes public housing 
projects; where Elaine's, the saloon of the literati, is just around the corner from a soup kitchen, where five- and 
six-story tenements share the same streets as private brownstones and expensive high-rises. It always has been home to a 
mix of the rich, the middle class and the poor, but the poor used to predominate and now they are being pushed out.</p>

<p>
<br>Mr. Morenzi said Mr. Grannis's office had received complaints of landlord harassment of elderly tenants who often pay
less than $200 a month for the same railroad flats that newcomers are willing to rent for $600 and up.</p>

<p>
<br>DAVID STERN, executive director of the Lenox Hill Neighborhood Association, which serves a large part of the Upper 
East Side, agreed. ''There are tremendous economic incentives for landlords to get people out'' he said. ''Three or four years
ago, if an elderly person became confused and became forgetful about paying rent, the landlord would call us up and say: 
'Could you look in on so and so?'</p>

<p>
<br>''Today that same landlord will not call us, or will sue for dispossess or eviction. He'll say to himself: 'Hey - I 
want to make $700 a month rent.' ''</p>

<p>
<br>The first residents will soon move into a 12- story, 82-unit cooperative at 402 East 90th Street called River East Plaza
formerly a garage. The one-bedrooms, priced between $113,363 and $167,475, are already sold out, according to John Cashman, 
a sales agent for J. I. Sopher & Company. ''You go down 10 blocks, and you start at $60,000 and $70,000 more,'' Mr. Cashman 
said. ''Down lower you get a glitzier lobby and smaller rooms.''</p>

<p>
<br>The first occupants also are moving into the Park East, a 22-story, 56-unit cooperative at 233 East 86th Street, where 
studios are priced at $83,000 and a duplex penthouse is $294,000.</p>

<p>
<br>In the next year ground will be broken for at least six major buildings:</p>

<p>
<br>- The Milstein family plans to erect a high- rise rental-apartment project of 939 units at 215 East 95th Street on 
			the block bounded by 95th and 96th Streets and Second and Third Avenues.</p>

<p>
<br>- Solomon Equities will build a 292-unit residential development at 93d and 94th Streets at Second Avenue that will 
			include a 32-story building, 12 town houses, a landscaped courtyard and commercial space.</p>

<p>
<br>The project, according to Jean Solomon, should attract an upper-middle-class clientele, families and singles. The 
construction manager is Tishman Realty & Construction. The architects are Sehuman, Claman, Lichenstein & Efron, with the 
firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill as design consultants. </p>

<p>
<br>''THIS is the new area for continuing development,'' said Mrs. Solomon, who owns Solomon Equities with her husband, 
David Solomon. The couple are completing Tower 49, an office building at Madison Avenue between 48th and 49th Streets.</p>

<p>
- Glenwood Management will start next spring on two luxury residential rental high- rise projects totaling 498 units at York 
Avenue between 90th and 92nd Streets.</p>

<p>
- At Third Avenue between 93d and 94th Streets, within the Ruppert Urban Renewal Site, Related Housing, Tishman Realty & 
Construction Company - builders of the World Trade Center and the John Hancock Tower in Chicago - and Wayne Kasbar, the 
developer, will build Carnegie Park, a 372- unit luxury high-rise.</p>

<p>
- At Second and Third Avenues and 93d and 94th Streets, also within the Ruppert site, the New York Foundation for Senior 
Citizens will build 131 rental apartments for the elderly and handicapped.</p>

<p>
<br>According to a report by Community Board 8, the finished or nearly finished projects in the last five years include two 
luxury apartment buildings on East 90th Street, residential towers on Third Avenue at 95th Street and on East 93d and 94th 
Streets at First Avenue.</p>

<p>
<br>In addition, a condominium tower has risen at 223 East 86th Street, and several older buildings in the neighborhood have been
remodelled.</p>

<p>
<br>''It's not dramatic, but it's like a rebirth,'' said Mrs. Fisher, of Community Board 8. ''This is the last frontier.''</p>

<p>
<br>While developers and residents talk of a building boom in Yorkville, the assessment of Rebecca Robertson, a city planner, 
is more cautious. ''I'm not sure it's changing as fast as people think,'' she said. ''This area has not yet reached its 
development potential. I wouldn't say it's booming in terms of development. It's starting to happen.''</p>

<p>
<br>Most of the pressure, she said, will be on the avenues, where there is prime space available for new high-rises. One such 
plot is at the northwest corner of 94th Street and First Avenue, where three nearly empty and derelict tenements are being 
offered for $2 million, an asking price predicated not on their current value but on their development potential.</p>

<p>
<br>Though Stanley Isaacs Houses are just across the street, any tall building erected on the plot would command river views with
a high market value.</p>

<p>
<br>In addition to fears about the eroding character of the neighborhood, the new development has brought concerns that services
will be overtaxed and overcrowded.</p>

<p>
<br>At rush hour, the Lexington Avenue subway already operates close to or at crush capacity, according to an recent impact study
by the city's Office of the Department of City Planning. The rush- hour line of riders waiting to buy tokens at the 86th Street
station invariably stretches onto the street.</p>

<p>
<br>But even though Yorkville is changing, traces of the old neighborhood linger. The Ideal Restaurant, which opened 51 years ago,
is still on 86th Street, its long counter packed at mealtimes with people who like German food and know a bargain when they see
one - potato pancakes with applesauce for $3.75, Wiener schnitzel, string beans and fried potatoes for $5.95, corned beef and 
cabbage and potatoes for $4.95.</p>

<p>
<br>Mr. Morenzi still lives with his wife and three children in the kind of apartment building that once prevailed, a five-story 
walk-up where the residents are not just neighbors but also friends.</p>

<p>
<br>The parents of a grade-school friend of his also live there, along with a former boxer, a 90-year-old man and an actor. Keeping
the tenants happy is the resident super, Johnny Stanton, who also is a published short-story writer.</p>

<p>
<br>Mr. Morenzi works on First Avenue, next to Glaser's Bake Shop, where croissants were recently introduced. Despite its new 
offering, Glaser's, with its tin ceiling, solid oak cabinets and one of the bakers in residence upstairs, is much as it was 
81 years ago, when it was opened by a German immigrant named John Glaser. Today his son and two grandsons run the bakery.</p>
   
<p>
<br>The newcomers could easily go to other, fancier bakeries, but they come instead to Glaser's - a sign, perhaps, of the 
continuing appeal of the old character of the neighborhood.</p>
